    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <th>Module</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data Loader & Preprocessor</td>
        <td>Loads CSV data, handles missing values, and extracts key date features (Year, Month, Day, Weekday, and ordinal date) for analysis.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Linear Regression Module</td>
        <td>Builds and evaluates a multivariate linear regression model using engineered features and time series cross-validation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ARIMA Forecasting Module</td>
        <td>Implements a univariate ARIMA model to capture temporal patterns and predict future revenue with confidence intervals.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Visualization Suite</td>
        <td>Provides comprehensive plots including actual versus predicted revenue, residual analysis, and future forecast visualization.</td>

    <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
      Data preprocessing is critical to the success of any predictive model. This project includes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Parsing date values from CSV and sorting the data chronologically.</li>
      <li>Handling missing revenue data using forward fill techniques.</li>
      <li>Extracting additional features from the date (Year, Month, Day, Weekday) and converting dates into an ordinal format for regression analysis.</li>
      <li>Ensuring data integrity and consistency across both modeling approaches.</li>
    </ol>
